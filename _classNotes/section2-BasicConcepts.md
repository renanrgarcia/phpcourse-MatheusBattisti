# Base concepts
## Case sensitivity
- Instructions are case-insensitive, but variables are case-sensitive

## Code instructions
- One line finishes with a `;`
- Multiple lines are within `{}`

## Blank spaces
- Blank lines and line breaks are ignored, avoid them

## Comments
- Comments start with `//`, another way is `#`
- Multiple line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`

## Reserved words
- Examples: `function`, `while`, `return`
